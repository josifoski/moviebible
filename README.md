# Instalation  
You will need Lazarus  
http://www.lazarus-ide.org/  
to (once only) compile  
program for your operating system.  
It's very easy, just open mbfbh.lpr via Lazarus  
File/Open and hit on green triangle icon. (or via Menu Run/Run)  
  
After that you can use only your executable. (mbfbh or mbfbh.exe)
